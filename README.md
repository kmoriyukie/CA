# Notes:
## PBD
My first attempt to simulate cloth was made using PBD, the code used for it can be found in the constraintsPBD class. Unfortunately, it did not work as it should, as sometimes it would stretch too much and behave almost like a very viscuous fluid. Because of this, and because of feedback received from the professor, I have decided to change my approach and use the method that was originally proposed.
